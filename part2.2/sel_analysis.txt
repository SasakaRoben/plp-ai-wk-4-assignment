AI-assisted testing tools such as Testim.io or Selenium IDE with AI plugins simplify script creation by automatically identifying dynamic elements, predicting test flows, and suggesting assertions. 
Unlike manual testing, which requires explicit scripting and human validation, AI-based tools continuously learn from previous runs to adapt to UI changes, reducing test maintenance overhead.

AI also improves test coverage by exploring additional user paths that manual testers may overlook, increasing reliability across browsers and environments. 
This ensures faster feedback cycles, fewer false negatives, and higher overall test accuracy.
