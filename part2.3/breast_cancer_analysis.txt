The Random Forest model performs exceptionally well on this dataset, offering both high accuracy and F1-score. 
The algorithm’s ensemble nature reduces overfitting while maintaining predictive stability. 
Data preprocessing (handling missing values and encoding labels) ensures the model generalizes effectively.

By mapping diagnostic outcomes to issue priorities (high/medium/low), the system can help allocate computational or team resources efficiently, focusing on “high-risk” issues first. 
AI-driven analytics thus enhance decision-making in DevOps and operations planning.
