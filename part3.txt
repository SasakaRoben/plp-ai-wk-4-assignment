When deploying a predictive model in a company setting, potential bias in the dataset becomes a critical ethical concern. 
If the data used to train the model is unbalanced — for instance, overrepresenting one department, team, or demographic group — the model might prioritize certain outcomes unfairly. 
In practice, this could mean that issue severity predictions or resource allocations favor teams whose data patterns dominate the training set. 
Underrepresented teams might receive fewer resources or slower response times, perpetuating inequality and reducing trust in AI-driven decisions.

Bias can also stem from historical data that encodes human subjectivity or organizational culture. 
If certain issue types were historically deprioritized, the model may learn to continue that trend.

Fairness tools like IBM AI Fairness 360 (AIF360) help address these biases by offering bias detection, measurement, and mitigation techniques. 
For example, AIF360 can compute fairness metrics such as disparate impact or equal opportunity difference, identify where bias exists, and apply reweighting or resampling algorithms to balance the dataset. 
Integrating such tools ensures that predictive analytics remain transparent, accountable, and fair — preserving both ethical standards and user confidence in AI systems.
